# Create Marketing Automation

Design and implement a marketing automation solution:

**Requirements:** $ARGUMENTS

## Implementation Process:
1. **Requirements Analysis** - Break down automation needs
2. **Technical Architecture** - Claude Code + MCP server integration
3. **Data Flow Design** - Inputs, processing, outputs, feedback loops
4. **Implementation Plan** - Phased development approach
5. **Testing Strategy** - Validation and quality assurance
6. **Deployment Plan** - Go-live and monitoring setup

## Technical Considerations:
- Use sequential-thinking MCP for complex logic
- Leverage puppeteer for web automation tasks
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
- Ensure LGPD compliance for all data handling
- Optimize for performance (<2.5s LCP requirement)
- Include comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Deliverables:
- **Architecture Diagram** - Visual representation of automation flow
- **Implementation Code** - Production-ready Claude Code solution
- **Configuration Files** - All necessary setup and environment configs
- **Documentation** - Technical specs and user guides
- **Testing Results** - Validation of functionality and performance
- **ROI Metrics** - Baseline measurements and success criteria

## Quality Standards:
- All code must pass lint, typecheck, and build processes
- Include smoke tests for critical functionality
- Document all external integrations and dependencies
- Provide rollback procedures for safe deployment
- Implement monitoring and alerting systems

Focus on creating robust, scalable automation that delivers measurable business value.
